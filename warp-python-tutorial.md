# Warp AI Terminal Tutorial: Python Development Made Simple

Welcome to this comprehensive tutorial on using Warp's AI-powered terminal for Python development! This guide will walk you through Warp's most powerful features, designed especially for beginners to Python coding.

## What You'll Learn

- **Agentic Coding**: Let Warp's AI Agent write, modify, and debug code for you
- **Interactive Development**: Use Warp's smart features for real-time coding assistance
- **Debugging & Testing**: Identify and fix issues with AI assistance
- **Workflows**: Streamline your development process with Warp's automation features
- **Notebooks**: Create executable documentation and tutorials

## Prerequisites

- Basic familiarity with using a terminal
- Python 3.7+ installed on your system
- No prior Python experience required!

---

## Part 1: Setting Up Your Development Environment

Let's start by creating a new Python project and setting up our workspace.

```warp-runnable-command
mkdir warp-python-demo && cd warp-python-demo
```

```warp-runnable-command
python3 --version
```

### Creating a Virtual Environment

It's a best practice to use virtual environments for Python projects:

```warp-runnable-command
python3 -m venv tutorial_env
```

```warp-runnable-command
source tutorial_env/bin/activate
```

## Part 2: Agentic Coding - Let AI Write Your Code

One of Warp's most powerful features is its AI Agent that can write complete programs for you. Let's demonstrate this by asking the AI to create different types of Python applications.

### Example 1: Simple Calculator

**Try this**: In Warp's command line, type:
```
@agent Create a Python calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide) with error handling
```

The AI Agent will:
1. Create a complete Python file
2. Include proper error handling
3. Add comments explaining the code
4. Make it user-friendly for beginners

### Example 2: File Organizer

**Try this**: Ask the agent to create a more complex program:
```
@agent Create a Python script that organizes files in a directory by their extensions, moving them into appropriate folders
```

### Example 3: Data Analysis Tool

**Try this**: For something more advanced:
```
@agent Create a Python script that reads a CSV file, analyzes the data, and creates simple visualizations using matplotlib
```

---

## Part 3: Interactive Development and Real-time Assistance

Warp provides intelligent suggestions and auto-completion as you code. Let's explore these features.

### Smart Command Completion

Try typing these commands and notice how Warp suggests completions:

```warp-runnable-command
pip install {{package_name}}
```

```warp-runnable-command
python -m {{module_name}}
```

### AI-Powered Command Suggestions

When you're unsure about a command, just describe what you want to do:

**Examples to try:**
- "How do I install a Python package?"
- "How do I run a Python script?"
- "How do I check what Python packages are installed?"

---

## Part 4: Debugging and Error Resolution

Let's create a program with intentional bugs and see how Warp helps us fix them.

```warp-runnable-command
cat > buggy_program.py << 'EOF'
def calculate_average(numbers):
    total = 0
    for num in numbers:
        total += num
    return total / len(numbers)  # Bug: division by zero if empty list

def process_user_input():
    user_input = input("Enter numbers separated by commas: ")
    numbers = user_input.split(",")
    # Bug: strings not converted to numbers
    return numbers

def main():
    numbers = process_user_input()
    avg = calculate_average(numbers)
    print(f"The average is: {avg}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
EOF
```

```warp-runnable-command
python buggy_program.py
```

When you encounter errors, you can ask Warp's AI Agent to help:

**Try asking:**
```
@agent Fix the errors in buggy_program.py and explain what was wrong
```

---

## Part 5: Testing and Quality Assurance

Let's create a complete project with tests to demonstrate Warp's testing capabilities.

### Creating a Simple Library

**Ask the agent:**
```
@agent Create a Python module called 'math_utils.py' with functions for basic mathematical operations, and create a separate test file using pytest
```

### Running Tests

```warp-runnable-command
pip install pytest
```

```warp-runnable-command
pytest test_math_utils.py -v
```

### Code Quality Checks

```warp-runnable-command
pip install flake8 black
```

```warp-runnable-command
flake8 math_utils.py
```

```warp-runnable-command
black math_utils.py
```

---

## Part 6: Workflows and Automation

Warp can help automate common development workflows. Let's create some useful automation scripts.

### Automated Project Setup

**Ask the agent:**
```
@agent Create a Python script that sets up a new Python project with a virtual environment, requirements.txt, and basic project structure
```

### Git Workflow Automation

```warp-runnable-command
git init
```

```warp-runnable-command
git add .
```

```warp-runnable-command
git commit -m "Initial commit: Warp tutorial project"
```

**Try asking:**
```
@agent Create a script that automates the git workflow: staging, committing with a descriptive message, and pushing to remote
```

---

## Part 7: Advanced Features

### Working with APIs

**Ask the agent:**
```
@agent Create a Python script that fetches data from a public API (like JSONPlaceholder) and saves it to a JSON file
```

### Database Integration

**Ask the agent:**
```
@agent Create a simple Python script that creates a SQLite database, adds sample data, and queries it
```

### Web Scraping Example

**Ask the agent:**
```
@agent Create a Python web scraper using requests and BeautifulSoup that extracts data from a simple webpage
```

---

## Part 8: Notebook Integration

Warp's Notebook feature allows you to create interactive, executable documentation. This tutorial itself is an example of a notebook!

### Creating Your Own Notebook

1. Save this file as a `.md` file
2. Open it in Warp
3. Use the `warp-runnable-command` blocks to make commands executable
4. Share with your team for collaborative development

### Best Practices for Notebooks

- Use clear section headers
- Include explanatory text between code blocks
- Add parameter placeholders with `{{parameter_name}}`
- Document expected outputs

---

## Part 9: Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Python Environment Issues

```warp-runnable-command
which python
```

```warp-runnable-command
pip list
```

**If you have issues, ask:**
```
@agent Help me troubleshoot Python environment issues - I'm getting import errors
```

### Package Installation Problems

```warp-runnable-command
pip install --upgrade pip
```

**For complex dependency issues:**
```
@agent Help me resolve package dependency conflicts in my Python project
```

## Part 10: Next Steps and Advanced Topics

### Explore More AI Capabilities

Try asking the agent to help with:
- Creating unit tests for existing code
- Optimizing slow Python code
- Converting scripts to object-oriented design
- Adding logging and configuration management
- Creating command-line interfaces with argparse or click

### Integration with Development Tools

```warp-runnable-command
pip install jupyter ipython
```

**Ask the agent:**
```
@agent Show me how to integrate Jupyter notebooks with my Python development workflow
```

### Deployment and Distribution

**Ask the agent:**
```
@agent Help me create a setup.py file and package my Python project for distribution
```
